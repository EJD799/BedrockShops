**DISCLAIMER: THERE ARE NO REAL MONEY TRANSACTIONS IN THIS ADDON. ALL MENTIONS OF MONEY ARE IN-GAME.**

This addon adds two blocks: the player shop and the admin shop. Player shops can be created and edited by regular players, although they can only be edited or destroyed by the player who placed them. They can also be edited or destroyed by admins. They have an inventory that players must add items to for selling or buying in exchange for money. Admin shops can only be created and edited by admins, and players cannot edit or destroy them. They have an unlimited amount of items, and do not need to be restocked.

Additionally, this addon adds two items: the shop editor and the shop dashboard. Shop editors are used to edit a shop. To use one, simply right-click on a shop while holding the shop editors. If you own the shop, an editor GUI will appear. The shop dashboard is used by admins for configuring settings.

Admin Shops and Shop Dashboards do not have crafting recipes, as they are intended only for admin use.
